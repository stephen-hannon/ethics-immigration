And he explains how the mentality of Americans has shifted to embrace collectivism, and skepticism, which has allowed the notion of big government “taking care” of people to grow and spread. This talk took place at Objectivist Summer Conference 2017 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</p>

                                      I definitely agree with Yaron’s arguments. Our country grew with immigrants and the economic growth has a positive effect on my life. As the owner of a company, I enjoy the idea of employing qualified immigrants that will not only benefit my company but will also benefit our community.

 										What a great video! Immigration is an important part of our history and we should be grateful for their positive impacts in our society and economy. I think we should welcome people from all around the world and give them opportunities to work and live in our country. As Yaron argued, this is mutually beneficial to our community and to these immigrants.

                                    I agree with Yaron based on the premise that these immigrants are legally working and have the proper visa. Immigration had an important and positive impact in our society and we should incentive these movements within the American laws. As Yaron argued, these movements made it possible for our country to grow faster and efficiently; thus, we should support them within the boundaries of our legal system.									</div>

As a US citizen, I want to say that the focus on aiding illegal immigrants distracts from taking care of US citizens. It adds to an already full agenda. I think it’s hopeful for the Dreamers but distracts from the current US system’s care for its own citizens. The video by Google makes the Dreamers seem like they are doing good work, but I think it’s better for their sake to make those positive impacts in their own countries, while those who are citizens of the US make their strides here. And translated into the tech industry, there are Dreamers who seek to make advancements with their education, and I think they may be good, but it also adds to the pool of educated people. So again, they add to an already full mix of citizens.

                                    I think the video touches on a good direction for the country to proceed in. The principles addressed about DACA and Dreamers can be applied to immigrants who want to work in the US industries. People are doing their best to be the best selves, no matter where they come from. Dreamers don’t come in to ruin relationships but add to an increasingly diverse conversation. I think Google’s taking a good step in the right direction, advocating for those stuck in a legal limbo, as it will hopefully allow people to form better relationships and help understand the situation, which would hopefully build a positive feedback loop into opening up the US industries.

The situation with DACA and undocumented students goes against the current government system. While they did come into the country unknowingly, the system should not be at blame for the illegal entrance and stay. It does not make sense to provide these people a legal status just because they know no life outside of the US, especially with the multitude of people who are patient and following the proper legal procedures to travel and stay. Google took a misstep with this as they are aiding them to take the easy way out.

                                      As a homeowner and employee in Silicon Valley I have seen an explosion of new businesses and huge financial returns on my investments in the area. Listening to this video talk about how companies are considering moving to Canada in order to circumvent the immigration laws put in place by the U.S. made me deeply upset. How will my numerous real estate investments be as profitable if all the tech companies move out of the states. Not only this but being able to work in the headquarters of my local tech company has given me huge opportunities that would be crushed if I was forced to work in just a branch of the company. These immigrants would be getting the better clients and higher pay raises. I simply cannot stand for that.

                                        Watching this video gave me hope for the world. Companies such as Humanyze are willing to leave the U.S. for the betterment of their employees. However, it is sad that the U.S. does not care enough for these people to change the immigration laws and encourage them to come work here. I believe that wherever these people are accepted is where they should work, not only from a financial standpoint but from a social one. If these employees are welcomed by all of society where they are working their mental health will be greater and they will be able to enjoy their professional and social lives.

                                      From a legal standpoint, these companies have every right to move their business to wherever they want in order to ensure that their employees are all legal to work there. Considering that Canada has the legal framework to allow more immigrants to work for these companies, whatever the financial repercussions to the company or the area the legality behind it is solid.

                                        I’m happy with what I saw. I understand these companies’ desire to increase their profits, and if lucrative government contracts are the way to do so, why stop them? I’m not one-dimensional, though: a company should care about more than the bottom line. It should concern itself with the happiness of its employees, customers, and stakeholders; the positivity of its publicity, and the quality of its products and services. However, profits are tied closely to each of these. But just as I support companies taking whatever jobs help them the most, I support employees protesting unethical contracts. Many people are concerned with the immigration crisis of recent years, and if protesting their company’s contribution to the crisis makes them not feel guilty, more power to them. Customers also should oppose such companies and make their opinions known by not buying their products. However, it all evens out: companies must calculate these factors and weigh the potential financial losses with the potential gains of taking an unethical job.

 This was a troubling video. Tech companies love to talk about their diversity and the benefits that immigrants bring to tech, but is it just lip service? You can’t truly care about people who are immigrants if you turn around and work with the government and their anti-immigration policies. How could anyone see the photos of children being held in cages and not be horrified and heartbroken? Tech companies have enormous power to do good and help solve the problems in our immigration system, which they are doing by hiring talented immigrants on visas. However, it is a shame that they turn around and do this.

                                    I’ll be the first to admit that our government is not perfect; no government in history has been or will be. But we have to trust the government, because otherwise society would suffer. The U.S. government has set its policies on immigration, and we need a basic level of trust that the laws were set for a reason and are reasonable. For this reason, companies should have no qualms about taking government contracts, because following the laws of the land is the right thing to do. My legalist views don’t just apply to the federal level; a company’s leadership should also be trusted to make ethical decisions. Therefore, it is not the job of an employee to criticize the decisions of higher-ups.

They pay enough for employees to stay afloat and in return, employees do high-quality work during working hours.

					    I feel for outsourced H1-B workers who have been hired by companies who abuse this system. This was supposed to be a visa that hires people of extraordinary talent, but companies are whoever is available on the other side of the world to do experimental projects and tasks people are too lazy to do. These people travel halfway across the world, leave their families and lives behind, work long hours through the evening, risk deportation and firing if they ever question their managers, only to get paid half of what their colleagues are making in a city with a high cost of living? Come on. You tech people say you are building products that make people’s lives better but are treating your own workers like dirt.

					Whatever these companies are doing is legal, because H1-B visas are meant to allow companies to hire talents from around the world. There is no rule that says these H1-B employees need to make as much as their colleagues. If their job is worth $75k a year, then that is what they deserve.
