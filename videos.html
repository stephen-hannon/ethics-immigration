                            <p class="card-text">In this clip, Yaron Brook discusses the positive impact of immigration and technology and how these two have historically shaped America. And he explains how the mentality of Americans has shifted to embrace collectivism, and skepticism, which has allowed the notion of big government “taking care” of people to grow and spread. This talk took place at Objectivist Summer Conference 2017 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</p>

                                      As a homeowner and employee in Silicon Valley I have seen an explosion of new businesses and huge financial returns on my investments in the area. Listening to this video talk about how companies are considering moving to Canada in order to circumvent the immigration laws put in place by the U.S. made me deeply upset. How will my numerous real estate investments be as profitable if all the tech companies move out of the states. Not only this but being able to work in the headquarters of my local tech company has given me huge opportunities that would be crushed if I was forced to work in just a branch of the company. These immigrants would be getting the better clients and higher pay raises. I simply cannot stand for that.

                                        Watching this video gave me hope for the world. Companies such as Humanyze are willing to leave the U.S. for the betterment of their employees. However, it is sad that the U.S. does not care enough for these people to change the immigration laws and encourage them to come work here. I believe that wherever these people are accepted is where they should work, not only from a financial standpoint but from a social one. If these employees are welcomed by all of society where they are working their mental health will be greater and they will be able to enjoy their professional and social lives.

                                      From a legal standpoint, these companies have every right to move their business to wherever they want in order to ensure that their employees are all legal to work there. Considering that Canada has the legal framework to allow more immigrants to work for these companies, whatever the financial repercussions to the company or the area the legality behind it is solid.

                                        I’m happy with what I saw. I understand these companies’ desire to increase their profits, and if lucrative government contracts are the way to do so, why stop them? I’m not one-dimensional, though: a company should care about more than the bottom line. It should concern itself with the happiness of its employees, customers, and stakeholders; the positivity of its publicity, and the quality of its products and services. However, profits are tied closely to each of these. But just as I support companies taking whatever jobs help them the most, I support employees protesting unethical contracts. Many people are concerned with the immigration crisis of recent years, and if protesting their company’s contribution to the crisis makes them not feel guilty, more power to them. Customers also should oppose such companies and make their opinions known by not buying their products. However, it all evens out: companies must calculate these factors and weigh the potential financial losses with the potential gains of taking an unethical job.

 This was a troubling video. Tech companies love to talk about their diversity and the benefits that immigrants bring to tech, but is it just lip service? You can’t truly care about people who are immigrants if you turn around and work with the government and their anti-immigration policies. How could anyone see the photos of children being held in cages and not be horrified and heartbroken? Tech companies have enormous power to do good and help solve the problems in our immigration system, which they are doing by hiring talented immigrants on visas. However, it is a shame that they turn around and do this.

                                    I’ll be the first to admit that our government is not perfect; no government in history has been or will be. But we have to trust the government, because otherwise society would suffer. The U.S. government has set its policies on immigration, and we need a basic level of trust that the laws were set for a reason and are reasonable. For this reason, companies should have no qualms about taking government contracts, because following the laws of the land is the right thing to do. My legalist views don’t just apply to the federal level; a company’s leadership should also be trusted to make ethical decisions. Therefore, it is not the job of an employee to criticize the decisions of higher-ups.
