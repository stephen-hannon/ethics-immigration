                      As a US citizen I have lived here my entire life and upon spending years of my life and thousands of my dollars obtaining a degree, I emerged to find the job market saturated with people who have obtained a H-1B visa. As a staunch believer in egoism, this is absurd to me. I worked hard. I deserve a job. This document claims that “Congress put in place a number of measures intended to protect U.S. workers”, but even with a advanced degree from the University of Phoenix I cannot find a job. Why should an immigrant with a Computer Science degree from Stanford get a job before a hardworking american who logged into an online class every once in a while. Thank God for Donald Trump putting through Proclamation 10014 to prevent more people from taking my jobs.

                      People from across the world see our country as a beacon of hope and a place where they can come and live out the American dream like every other immigrant has before them. Reading through this document and seeing all the hoops that immigrants have to jump through just to get the opportunity to work in the U.S. is crazy to me. Not only does it show how hard it is for people to obtain an H-1B but it shows how companies are abusing these visas to get highly skilled laborers at a reduced cost to American workers. Many of these immigrants are more skilled than Americans and much harder working so they should be paid based on their qualifications not where they come from.

                      This document dives deep into the different aspects of immigration law and especially the H-1B visa. The legal precedent is outlined very clearly in the US Code 1101 as it states “nonimmigrants aliens coming temporarily to the United States to perform services in a specialty occupation” and in all definitions of the word many jobs being filled by immigrants with H-1B visas are specialty occupations. In addition US Code 1184 qualifies how these occupations are approved for the proper classification necessary.

                      I am a proud red-, white-, and blue-blooded American citizen, and I am not afraid to stand up for myself or my country. Mark Krikorian got this right; it is special interests that are trying to import foreigners for cheap labor. I understand these powerful companies want to do what’s best for them, but we must hold them accountable by rejecting their interests and advocating for our own. For me personally, my son is trying to find a stable, well-paying job, but the influx of workers is driving wages down. My son should want to make as much as possible, and these aliens are clogging up the pipelines with cheap labor. I understand that immigrants are trying to do what’s best for themselves, and good for them—but it’s not my job to do the work for them.

                      I strongly oppose this order because of its inhumane effects on immigrants. Migrants are the backbone of America, and we should be treating them with the same rights and respect as any U.S. citizen. Immigrant workers have a very positive economic impact, sure, but we should be treating them simply as tools to a good economy. What about the fact that these immigrants are human beings? Not only are they smart and talented, they have to work incredibly hard to move and assimilate to a new and unfamiliar culture. Tim Cook hit it right on the head; everyone should have a fair shot at pursuing the American Dream. And before anyone says anything about illegal immigration, we shouldn’t let arbitrary rules get in the way of caring for other people. Undocumented immigrants are just searching for a better life for themselves and their families. Wouldn’t you want to do the same if you were in their shoes?

                      Not sure where I stand on this one. I support President Trump making this executive action, because I trust him as the elected president to do what is best for our society. However, I am slightly concerned about the consequences. I agree with Lindsey Graham that legal immigration is clearly a net positive for our country, and I worry that restrictions on legal immigration through H1-B, J-1, L-1, and other visas will incentivize more people to use illegal methods of coming to the country. This feeds a disrespect for the law and order of this country.

 I am a CEO of a tech startup that recently IPO’d and my parents came here when I was little to start a new life. To me, this is insulting because I am creating jobs for not only American people, but everyone around the world who has the competency to perform on the jobs I create. I run a business that needs to thrive. My product is used by millions of people and that number will keep growing. Without the H1-B visas that I depend on, I will be missing workers who are integral to the maintenance of my servers, database, and platforms. Forcing me to only look for talent in America will put a strain on the company, and our product thrives with diverse developers since it’s since by millions around the world. Having my access to worldwide talent blocked because of a short-sighted immigration restriction like this will destroy my company and lose many jobs.

 We should not ban newly requested H1-B visas, as this is ignorant to the experiences shared by many current holders and graduating students who are capable of and qualified to work in multiple industries. Current H1-B visa holders and foreign students who are working or about to work at our companies are creating consumer products and boosting job opportunities. They are paying rent, gas stations, delivery workers, and contributing to our economy by living here so we should respect their right to stay here. We are putting our own economy at risk if we do not fill in these spots quickly, and will lose our competitive edge to other superpowers like China. It takes time and resources (that we might not have) to train an American citizen to fill the spot when we can hire an already qualified candidate who is a non-citizen.

 Rules are rules. They are not meant to be broken, but to be followed. That’s why they’re called rules. The President is the commander in chief of our beloved country, and I support whatever he has to say about this issue. He was chosen to be our leader through a legal process, and his job entails enforcing laws and implementing rules for our country. He is doing whatever he legally can to come up with the best possible solution for everyone, and I trust that he is making the right decision. They might come here legally with these visas, but if the president sees their being here as unfit to our people who are currently battling a pandemic, it is in the president’s best interest to prioritize American jobs and lives.

                    As an immigrant, I am completely on board with how ITI is addressing the immigration reform. Not only will this be an improvement in the workforce with a talented addition of many people, but it will also give me a chance to contribute and receive what I have worked for. I think it’s ethical for me to have a chance to not only comfortably work here, but also become a citizen at some point if I decide to settle because it will provide me the best opportunity to deliver my talents.

                    I appreciate this series of posts on the ITI website, because they discuss how important diverse relationships are in the workplace. From a moral stance, it’s important to look past a person’s citizenship because they bring a lot to improve the tech industry.
In the current situation, many people are stuck in a limbo as they are trying to receive status to be a legal professional in the US. But with the continuing discussion of immigration reform, as supported by ITI, there is not only a step in the right direction to build on a talented workforce, but allows the people to comfortably reside and receive what they deserve and have worked hard for.
While the official stance of the ITI seems to concern the relationship with the economy, to note here is that they really value the well-being of immigrants as if they were American citizens themselves.

                    In my opinion, immigration reform is a step in the wrong direction. The rules were set up for a reason, and there is no reason to modify it; the people don’t need to work in the US and contribute their talents to their home country and may find a better time with their influence there. While it is important for the economy to continue growing, this could open the door for more unemployment with a bigger pool of talent. I think there is a good balance right now, according to the laws, and introducing more diversity to improve the workforce is an unachievable ideal. So while further limitations are understandably unethical, immigration reform is unnecessary.

As a supporter of the egoism ethical framework, I am in favor of the ITI decision to welcome the Trump Administration to rescind rules barring international students that are not enrolled in an in-person class. These students bring multiple contributions to my community and economy; thus, barring them from entering the country would have negative consequences in my life. Although they will not necessarily be enrolled in in-person class, they should be able to choose to go to their college and contribute to the community there.

 I strongly believe that ITI’s decision of welcoming the Trump administration to rescind rules barring international students was correct. These actions against the international community have multiple negative effects on that group; therefore, they should reconsider them. These students come from all around the world to attend our universities and they bring multiple contributions to our community and economy. Thus, I believe that we should welcome these students, even if they are only taking online classes.

Although international students receive a visa to attend in-person classes, I believe that these students should be able to enter the US even if they are not enrolled in in-person classes. When the pandemic started, these students were allowed to stay in our country; even if they were not having in-person classes, which is a precedent for making this decision today. As a legalist, I would agree to the ITI decision to welcome the Trump administration decision to rescind rules barring international students. If there was a law that allowed them to stay in the country during the pandemic, then they should still be able to do it.
